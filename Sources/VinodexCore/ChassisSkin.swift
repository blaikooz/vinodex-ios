/// Moved here from VinodexUI by arch **A6**, with only the persisted half: the
/// raw values, the storage key, the label and the emblem. Every colour this
/// skin wears — `body`, `panel`, `orb`, `accent`, `control`, the marquee
/// phosphor and the status lamps — is still declared in
/// `Sources/VinodexUI/Chassis/ChassisSkins.swift`, now as an extension. See the
/// note at the top of `ScreenMode.swift` for why the split falls there.
///
/// A skin used to be four greys and a body colour: swap it and you got the same
/// cyan orb, the same amber Home button and the same green marquee in a
/// different-coloured tray. The moulding changed and none of the *parts* did,
/// which is why four of the five read as recolours of one device rather than as
/// five devices. Each now carries its own orb, its own lit-button ramp and its
/// own marquee phosphor.
///
/// **Vinodex Classic is deliberately untouched** — every value for `.classic`
/// is what the whole chassis used before this existed. It is the house device
/// and the reference the others are variations on; changing it would move the
/// baseline rather than add to it.
